# eldoc-display
Display eldoc in a child frame (when posframe is available) or a side window.

### How to install
At the moment, you have to install manually. Just clone this repo and add it to load-path.

### How to use
Enable `eldoc-display-mode` to use it. If you have installed posframe and use Emacs 
in a graphic environment, it will display eldoc in posframe. Otherwise, it will display
eldoc in a side window.
